## Contribution Guidelines
Do you plan to contribute? That's awesome. We don't have that many developers on it, so we're open to any type of contributions. If you're a developer, you'll start by forking the project and deploying that locally for further tests. 

To build the project for development:

**To install Node.js dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

**To watch the Vue component changes (Vue.js)**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**To watch the project changes (TailwindCSS)**
```bash
npm run css-watch
```

**To build the project for production:**
```bash
npm run prod
```

## Troubleshooting

### CSRF Error After Installation
If you encounter CSRF errors after installation, make sure your website URL is correctly set in the `.env` file. The `APP_URL` must match your actual domain.

### Error After Database Setup (using `php artisan serve`)
If you're using `php artisan serve` and encounter infinite loading after database setup, simply refresh the page. This happens because Laravel restarts the development server when the `.env` file is updated.

If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please create an issue on GitHub or contact the maintainers directly.
